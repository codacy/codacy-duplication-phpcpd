This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to detect PHP code duplication using [PHPCPD](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpcpd/).

## Usage

You can create the docker by doing:

```bash
./scripts/publish.sh
```

The docker is ran with the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -v $srcDir:/src  <DOCKER_NAME>:<DOCKER_VERSION>
docker run -it -v $PWD/src/test/resources:/src codacy/codacy-duplication-phpcpd:latest
```

## Test

Before running the tests, you need to install PHPCPD:
  * Install php (make sure it is php7.1)
  * Install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
  * Install PHPCPD using: `composer global require "sebastian/phpcpd=VERSION"` (composer will also install required dependencies; for the VERSION value use the one encoded in the .phpcpd-version file)
  * Make the `phpcpd command available in $PATH`
  
For more information check out the tools [README](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpcpd/blob/master/README.md).

After that, you can run the tests:

```bash
./scripts/test.sh
```
